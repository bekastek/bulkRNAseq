# bulkRNAseq

This is the conceptual framework for my bulk RNA-seq data analysis pipeline. All bulk RNA-seq data is derived from FAC-sorted cells from the mouse (mm10) main olfactory epithelium. This is a two-factor study with two groups in the primary factor (condition) and six groups in the secondary factor (timepoints). Other information is provided in the sample table (sex, age, etc).
